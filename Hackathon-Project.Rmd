# Introduction

The main goal of a movie poster is to hook an audience into the idea of the movie. It goes without saying then that different genres may have different strategies in grabbing the attention of their corresponding audience. One of the first thing that comes to your attention when you see a poster is the color. Family movies, for example, may frequently use lighter colors or higher RGB values, while horror films may use darker colors as to illicit an eerie feeling from just the poster.

In this project, we are using the posters of the top 1000 rated movies on IMDB, mapping those movies to the respective percentages of each color in that poster. With this information, we can make conclusions about the types of colors that different genres of movies use to attract their audience and perhaps even make some assumptions about why movies chose these colors.

# Background

We collected this data from <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows?resource=download">Kaggle.com</a> and it was initially compiled straight from the IMDB database 4 years ago.

From this dataset, we will be using the following variables:

<ul>

<li>**Genre**: A list of Genres that corresponds to each movie. We will mutate this to only include the first genre, being the strongest corresponding genre</li>

<li>**Poster_Link**: Link to a jpeg file of the poster of the corresponding movie. We used this to create a program returning the percentages of each color used in the poster</li>

<li>\*\*IMDB_Rating\*\*: Rating on IMDB out of ten to compare to the shade to test a later hypothesis</li>

</ul>

From this dataset, we created the following variable:

<ul>

<li>**Colors (**Red, Green, Blue, Maroon, Pink, Brown, Orange, Apricot, Olive, Yellow, Beige, Lime, Mint, Teal, Cyan, Navy, Purple, Lavender, Magenta, Black, Grey, White): A list of each color we are testing with the value corresponding to the percent of that color found in that poster</li>

</ul>

# Mapping Color from JPEG

Each movie in our data set had a URL that let to a JPEG of its poster. Our first job was to get useful information out of these JPEGs so we had a good set of data for our analysis. We took the following steps to get the color data from each poster:

1.  Scraped the contents of each webpage

2.  Converted each JPEG to the PPM format, a much more readily parsed image format

3.  Converted each PPM to a simple BitMap we made, that housed a table of pixels

4.  Creating a set of 22 simple, distinct, and representative colors of the movie posters

5.  Simplified each BitMap by classifying each pixel into one of the simple colors in our set by using the Euclidean distance between each pixel and each simple color, and setting each pixel to its closest match

6.  Finding the percentages of each simple color in each movie poster and exporting it in a CSV

# Visualization

```{r}
# Calculate the mean percentage for each color and genre
color_means <- long_data %>%
  group_by(Genre, Color) %>%
  summarize(mean_percentage = mean(Percentage), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  filter(Color != "Shade")

# Select the top 4 colors with the highest percentage for each genre
top_colors_per_genre <- color_means %>% 
  group_by(Genre) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = mean_percentage, n = 6) %>%
  ungroup()

# Define a color mapping for each color name
color_mapping <- c(
  "Red" = "red", "Green" = "green", "Blue" = "blue", "Maroon" = "#800000", 
  "Pink" = "pink", "Brown" = "#A52A2A", "Orange" = "orange", "Apricot" = "#FFB347",
  "Olive" = "#808000", "Yellow" = "yellow", "Beige" = "#F5F5DC", "Lime" = "green",
  "Mint" = "#98FF98", "Teal" = "lightblue", "Cyan" = "cyan", "Navy" = "navy",
  "Purple" = "purple", "Lavender" = "#E6E6FA", "Magenta" = "magenta",
  "Black" = "black", "Grey" = "grey", "White" = "white"
)

# Create a grouped bar chart with actual colors
ggplot(top_colors_per_genre, aes(x = Genre, y = mean_percentage, fill = Color)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", color = "black") +  # Adds black borders for better visibility
  scale_fill_manual(values = color_mapping) +  # Apply color mapping
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 12),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        legend.position = "right") + 
  labs(title = "Top 6 Average Color Percentages by Genre",
       x = "Movie Genre",
       y = "Average Percentage",
       fill = "Color")

# Hypothesis Testing

## Question: Is there a correlation between the percent of red in a poster and the genre that the movie is in?

### 

$$
H_0: \mu_{\text{Drama}} = \mu_{\text{Comedy}} \text{ ... } = \mu_{k} \\
H_{\alpha} = \text{at least 1 } \mu_{i} \neq \mu_{j} \text{ for all i, j}
$$

## Set the Significance Level

### $0.05$

## ANOVA Testing

### **Total Sum of Squares: SST**

Total variation in the dataset

$$
SST = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \overline{Y})^2 \\
Y_i = \text{each individual obervation in the sample} \\
\overline{Y} = \text{the mean of observations in the entire dataset}
$$

### **Sum of Squares Between Groups: SSB**

Variation between genre mean and total dataset mean

$$
SSB = \sum_{j=1}^{k} n_j (\overline{Y}_j - \overline{Y})^2 \\
n_j = \text{number of observations in genre } j \\
\overline{Y_j} = \text{mean observations in a genre } j \\
\overline{Y} = \text{mean of obervations in the entire dataset}
$$

### **Sum of Squares Within Groups: SSW**

Variation within each group

$$
SSW = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (Y_{ij} - \overline{Y}_j)^2 \\
Y_{ij} = \text{each obervation within a group } j \\
\overline{Y_j} = \text{mean of obervations within a group}
$$

### **Mean Square Between Each Group: MSB**

Mean of squares divided by degrees of freedom for f-distribution

$$
MSB = \frac{SSB}{k -1} \\
k = \text{number of genres}
$$

### **Mean Square Within Each Group: MSW**

$$
MSW = \frac{SSW}{n - k} \\
n - k = \text{number of movies - number of genres}
$$

### **F-Statistic**

$$
\frac{MSB}{MSW}
$$

### **P-Value**:

Calculate the likelihood of obtaining a result equal to or less likely than the F-Stat calculated under the F-Distribution

### Results

```{r}
grouped_movies

significant_data <- grouped_movies %>% drop_na() %>%
  select(Genre, Red, Maroon, Orange, Brown, Apricot, Beige, Mint, Purple, Magenta, Black, White, Cyan, Navy, Pink, Grey, Olive, Lime)


long_significant_data <- pivot_longer(significant_data, cols = -Genre, names_to = "Color", values_to = "Percentage")


top_genres <- long_significant_data %>%
  group_by(Color, Genre) %>%
  summarize(mean_percentage = mean(Percentage), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(Color, desc(mean_percentage)) %>%
  group_by(Color)


top_genres
significant_data
```

The following have significant p-values (less than 0.05):

<ul>

<li>Red</li>

<li>Maroon</li>

<li>Brown</li>

<li>Orange</li>

<li>Apricot</li>

<li>Beige</li>

<li>Mint</li>

<li>Purple</li>

<li>Black</li>

<li>White</li>

</ul>

The strongest mean percentage marked statistically significant is the `Western` genre with the color White. Other strong connections include `Crime` with black, and `Family` with Brown.
